# Internet-Speed-Test
The internet speed tester is a web-based application designed to measure the speed of your internet connection. It uses a JavaScript code that loads an image from a specified URL and calculates the time it takes to download the image. Based on the download time and the size of the image, the application estimates the internet speed in megabits per second (Mbps). The application displays the internet speed in a visually appealing manner and updates the speed each time the "CHECK" button is clicked.
